You’ve made 15 sales. You get a free Innermost Collection of your choice!<\/p><p>Gold Tier: 25 sales! Incredible. You’re getting an Innermost bag! <\/p><p>Elite Tier: 40 sales! You&#x27;re off the charts. An Innermost Habit Journal is on its way to you.<\/p><p>Each time you move up a tier, you’ll receive an email from us.

If you made a sale anytime in May that qualifies you to reach the next tier, we will process your reward around the 15th of April. Make sure your shipping address is the same by the 7th of every month, otherwise your rewards won’t arrive. We’ll announce when the goods are being shipped out each month via the ambassador Facebook group, so make sure you join.<\/p>",
